# Geneyx Analysis API Collection.postman.json
The API feature allows an account to automate sample workflows by pushing and pulling patient metadata from LIMS and EHR systems to and from Geneyx. This directory contains all of the scripts, with details of each field. Additionally, a collection of the scripts are available here:

https://github.com/geneyx/geneyx.analysis.api:

If you want to use an example API platform, a pubic source can be downloaded here: https://www.postman.com/.

Once downloaded, open the Postman application and next to “My Workspace” select “Import”. Click “Upload Files” and select: Geneyx Analysis API collection.postman_collection.json file that was downloaded.

This will create a collection of scripts with available fields that can be used to push or extract information from the Geneyx account. To use, you will need to obtain the API User ID and API User Key for your account, contact support@geneyx.com for this information.

Updating the fields in postman can be accessed by going to Body. Field structure should be in JSON format.
